      <!-- Lol this is actually wrong
      A section is meant to be within an article, not vice versa
      Article and section are interchangable, use section if more than one

      Section is a grouping of elements, several sections usually joined with a single header
      Article is a stand alone piece of content, distinct from the rest of the site (Independent section)
      Can have setions within articles and articles within sections

      Aside is a sidebar eg.
        Content on the page that isn't part of the main page
